I am playing around with html because it seems like it would be easy to reach a level where I'll be able to do something useful. And it runs in a browser - all I need is a browser and a text editor and I can push around command strings until they're arranged in a way I can extract non-tangible returns. I've never coded before so whatever I do is experimental. Android is already in my hand getting used, so relevance is a bit of a no-brainer. I'll just be using a regular entry level schmart phone for everything too.
