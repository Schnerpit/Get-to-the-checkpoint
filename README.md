I am playing around with html because it seems like it would be easy to reach a level where I'll be able to do something useful. And it runs in a browser - all I need is a browser and a text editor and I can push around command strings until they arranged in a way I can extract non-tangible returns. I've never coded before so whatever I do is experimental. Android is in my hand, right now. So it seems to be the most relevant platform so, yep. I'll just be using an entry level smart phone for most things.
